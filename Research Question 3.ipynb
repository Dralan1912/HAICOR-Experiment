    "Since this investigation, unlike [Research Question 1](Research%20Question%201.ipynb) and [Research Question 2](Research%20Question%202.ipynb), involves two distinct types of human-like reasoning paths generated either by a human or the COMET system, we will not be able to mix the two sets of experiments."

    "\n",
    "Based on [Research Question 2](Research%20Question%202.ipynb), the attention weight of a path can be used as an indication of the deep-learning model's belief in the quality of the reasoning path - higher attention weight implies better path quality. Similar to [Research Question 2](Research%20Question%202.ipynb), we will use the attention weights from instances where all reasoning paths are supplied."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Test results suggest that the deep-learning model fully recognizes human-generated reasoning paths as higher quality; it believes a majority of COMET-generated ones are reasonable. In this experiment, a reasoning path's syntax and semantic measure its human-likeness; this result suggests that the deep-learning model values the content of a path slightly more than its form. Therefore, future system designs should focus more on ensuring the quality, in terms of reasonability, of the reasoning paths than their grammatical structure."
